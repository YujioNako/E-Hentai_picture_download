<h4 align="center">A program download all pictures of an artwork by its url. Based on selenium.</h4>

## How it works
The program use selenium, and get pictures directly from the browser. Without using *requests* greatly reduced the risk of being ban.
## How to use
+ Make sure you have installed all needy packages, Firefox browser ,and added <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">geckodriver.exe</a> to your PATH.
+ Then copy the url of the artwork you like (like this: https://e-hentai.org/g/XXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXX/), and paste it when program ask you to do so.
+ Just wait a moment. The program may open your Firefox Browser, or return "XXX is deprecated". This is a normal phenomenon. Please don't care.
